# ðŸ“š About Developers Community Open Source Platform
 ðŸ‘‰ The idea is simple, you need to seek for the deficients in Repositories **and then just commit something new or commit a necessary change**

ðŸ‘‰ To do that you need to use **GitHub, any code-editor (compiler), git or github desktop**

## ðŸŽ¯ How to contribute to open source projects?

- You need to fork the repository first
- Then you need to clone the repository to your machine
- Then start writing your code inside of cloned repository
- When you're happy with it, you need to send a commit and leave a commit message for clarity
- Lastly, you need to create a Pull Request, tag 'Maintainers' as a reviewer and wait for it to be merged

## ðŸŽ¯ Content Rules | Permitted

- You are allowed to post personal links to your portfolios, projects or social media if you decide to add a signature to your contribution.
- You are only allowed to use personally owned images or videos. (Videos via embeds).
- You are allowed to submit codes that are already present on internet, make sure that codes are legit and working.
- You are encouraged to start with new repository, if you feel particular important

## ðŸŽ¯ Content Rules | Forbidden
